This project is a gesture-controlled Snake game that integrates Computer Vision techniques to create an interactive and immersive gameplay experience. The game uses MediaPipe Hands to track finger movements in real time, allowing players to control the snake through natural hand gestures instead of traditional keyboard input. It also incorporates face detection using face-api.js for Pose and Face Yoga challenges between levels. Additional features include a level system with progress tracking, an achievement system, electric orbs as hazard items, dynamic sound effects, and a neon grid UI design. The project demonstrates the practical application of computer vision in game development and explores the effectiveness of gesture-based interaction compared to conventional control methods.
